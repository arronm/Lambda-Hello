Hello, I'm Arron Marshall.

I am curious, meticulous, and genuine.

I enjoy far too many hobbies to pick and list one, some favorites are: 3D Modelling/Printing, Sumi-e, Woodworking, Gonfu Tea/Coffee (at a certain level I think these count as a hobby), Photography.

Favorite animal would have to be Rottweiler. I also love cats, and being in an apartment I currently have a Main Coon.
